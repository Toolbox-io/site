When working with this project, follow these rules:

- When adding API endpoints always document them in backend/main/@API_DOCS.md.

- When i ask you to do something with the project and you don't have any clarifying questions, 
  always automatically proceed with the edit without asking me for confirmation.

## Important Clarifications

- When working with API authentication in JS/TS, do NOT use { credentials: "include" }, instead use this:
  { 
      headers: {
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("authToken")}`
      }
  }

- When working with rate limits in the Python backend, the request handler function
  annotated with "limiter.limit('<rate limit string>')" should ALWAYS have the "request: Request"
  parameter zregardless of whether its used or not.

- This project uses SCSS instead of CSS and editing CSS files is an error, so find the SCSS file with
  the same name before editing.

## Coding Style

- Use 4-space indents in all files except .sh, .y(a)ml.

- When a reference is used only once, inline it instead of declaring a variable for it.
  If you are working with Python code and the reference is long declare it as a variable.

- Shorter code is preferred but clarity is important too. Do NOT spam comments in code, use them
  only when they actually clarify what the code does.

- When working with SCSS, nested styles are preferred. The styles should be nested according to the
  HTML hierarchy and styles like ".class:hover" should be defined inside the classes braces with
  "&:hover".
